# Cross-Domain Lifelong Reinforcement Learning for Wireless Sensor Networks

This repository provides a clean and reproducible implementation of a cross-domain lifelong reinforcement learning framework for non-stationary wireless sensor networks.

## Problem
Wireless sensor networks operate under non-stationary conditions caused by varying traffic, energy harvesting, and channel dynamics. Classical reinforcement learning fails to efficiently adapt across such changes.

## Method
We study a lifelong reinforcement learning approach that enables knowledge transfer across tasks and domains, improving convergence speed and long-term performance.

## Status
🚧 This repository is under active development.  
Reproducible simulations and baselines will be released incrementally.

## Reference
